# Analysis of the current implementation
## Threads
### Overview of Thread life cycle implementation in PintOS
A current implementation of threads in pintos starts at `main()` in `src/threads/init.c`. 
```c
int main(void){
  /* initizliation */
  thread_init();
  /* Init memory system */
  thread_start();
  /* shutdown */
  thread_ext();
}
```
`thread_init()`'s main purpose is to create the first thread for the pintos. 
One of the key feature of `thread_init()` is to set MAGIC value to running thread. 
Detail of MAGIC value is explained at the top of `thread.h`. 
MAGIC value is used to check whether the thread is valid or not. 
Since `struct thread` should not grow too large, `struct thread`'s magic member will 
work as validity checker whether the thread is valid or not.

`thread_start` will `thread_create` `idle` thread and `sema_down` to prevent other process to join. 
As soon as `idle thread` created, it will `sema_up` to release the last `sema_down` from `thread_create`.
Then, block idle itself. This will allow `run_action` in `main()` to run other thread.
This idle thread will wake up when there is no available thread to run.

`thread_create` will create a new thread according to givven argument. The function get 
a function name, priority and argument(`aux`). The function will allocate memory for
page for `sturct thread` and stack frame for `kernal_thread`, and `switching`. 
Initially, `init_thread` init thread in `THREAD_BLOCKED` state. Just before returning, 
`thread_unblock()` is called and set the thread state to `THREAD_READY`.

### Thread State
![thread_state](img/p1_1_thread_state.svg)
This is state diagram of thread life cycle. One exception is `THREAD_RUNNING` state,
which can be initialized by `thread_init()` called by `main()` to set the first thread.

`THREAD_READY`: thread is ready to run, but not running. Once a scheduler choose this thread,
it will be the next thread to run. Managed in `ready_list` in `src/threads/thread.c`.

`THREAD_RUNNING`: thread is running, only one thread can be in this state.

`THREAD_BLOCKED`: thread is blocked, waiting for SOMETHING (lock to be released, semaphore to be up, etc). 

`THREAD_DYING`: thread will be destroyed soon.


Above life cycle is implemented in `src/threads/thread.c` as enum `thread_status`.
This enum is stored in `status` member in `struct thread`.
```c
/* States in a thread's life cycle. */
enum thread_status
  {
    THREAD_RUNNING,     /* Running thread. */
    THREAD_READY,       /* Not running but ready to run. */
    THREAD_BLOCKED,     /* Waiting for an event to trigger. */
    THREAD_DYING        /* About to be destroyed. */
  };
```
The key algorithm for thread life cycle is how to choose "order of which thread to run next". In other words, 
how can OS manage a priority of thread in `ready_list`
